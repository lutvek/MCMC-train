Below is what we MUST do:

* analyse alg by doing tests and reporting these by:
-comparing p(s|O,G) (marginalizing over all sigmas) with p(s|O,G,sigma) where sigma is the sigma we generated the data with
-test above for different sizes of N, p, observation length
-present results as graphs and/or tables
-write about the results
-complete report

Below is what we COULD do if we have time:


* Optimize MH (now p_star_old_state is calculated more than once)
* Add hashmap for MH (same states does not to be calculated more than once)
* Optimize c(s,t,obs) (collapse some if states)
* Optimize new_sigma not in sigmas as we index this if new_sigma is in sigmas...
* Find other stuff to optimize...

* Change structure on Vertex class so that each vertex.L is another vertex, not index in G.vertexes
